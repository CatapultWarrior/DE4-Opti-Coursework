Subsystem 2: Catapult Efficiency Optimisation
=======

*Minimise energy required to raise the arm by varying mechanical parameters of the catapult arm*

Main Scripts 
-------
*Four algorithms are available: SQP, GA, Pattern Search and Interior Point*

MATLAB scripts should be run:
SQP.m
GA.m
PS.m
IP.m

Visualisation Script
*Visualisation of shape of objective function and some constraints*
Graph.m

Execution time
-------
The execution time is approximately 0.2 - 6 seconds depending on algorithm. GA will take the longest.

Dependencies
-------
The script requires only MATLAB_R2018b
