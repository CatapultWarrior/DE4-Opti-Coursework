Subsystem 2: Catapult Efficiency Optimisation
=======

*Minimise energy required to raise the arm by varying mechanical parameters of the catapult arm*

Main Scripts 
-------
*Four algorithms are available: SQP, GA, Pattern Search and Interior Point*

**MATLAB scripts should be run:**

SQP.m

GA.m

PS.m

IP.m

Visualisation Script
-------
*Visualisation of shape of objective function and some constraints*

Graph.m

Execution time
-------
The execution time is approximately 0.2 - 6 seconds depending on algorithm. GA will usually take the longest.

Processor used: Core i7-4710MQ

OS: Windows 7 Professional


Dependencies
-------
The script requires only MATLAB_R2018b
